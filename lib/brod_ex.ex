  Start a client.
  BootstrapEndpoints:
    Kafka cluster endpoints, can be any of the brokers in the cluster
    which does not necessarily have to be a leader of any partition,
    e.g. a load-balanced entrypoint to the remote kakfa cluster.
  ClientId:
    Atom to identify the client process
  Config:
    Proplist, possible values:
      restart_delay_seconds (optional, default=10)
        How much time to wait between attempts to restart brod_client
        process when it crashes
      max_metadata_sock_retry (optional, default=1)
        Number of retries if failed fetching metadata due to socket error
      get_metadata_timeout_seconds(optional, default=5)
        Return timeout error from brod_client:get_metadata/2 in case the
        respons is not received from kafka in this configured time.
      reconnect_cool_down_seconds (optional, default=1)
        Delay this configured number of seconds before retrying to
        estabilish a new connection to the kafka partition leader.
      allow_topic_auto_creation (optional, default=true)
        By default, brod respects what is configured in broker about
        topic auto-creation. i.e. whatever auto.create.topics.enable
        is set in borker configuration.
        However if 'allow_topic_auto_creation' is set to 'false' in client
        config, brod will avoid sending metadata requests that may cause an
        auto-creation of the topic regardless of what the broker config is.
      auto_start_producers (optional, default=false)
        If true, brod client will spawn a producer automatically when
        user is trying to call 'produce' but did not call
        brod:start_producer explicitly. Can be useful for applications
        which don't know beforehand which topics they will be working with.
      default_producer_config (optional, default=[])
        Producer configuration to use when auto_start_producers is true.
        @see brod_producer:start_link/4. for details about producer config
      ssl (optional, default=false)
        true | false | [{certfile, ...},{keyfile, ...},{cacertfile, ...}]
        When true, brod will try to upgrade tcp connection to ssl using default
        ssl options. List of ssl options implies ssl=true.
      sasl (optional, default=undefined)
        Credentials for SASL/Plain authentication.
        {plain, "username", "password"}
      connect_timeout (optional, default=5000)
        Timeout when trying to connect to one endpoint.
      request_timeout (optional, default=240000, constraint: >= 1000)
        Timeout when waiting for a response, socket restart when timedout.
